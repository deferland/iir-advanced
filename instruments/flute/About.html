<p>A native of Berkeley, California, Ms. Grim holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and Masters and Doctor of Musical Arts degrees from Yale University. She is currently Assistant Professor of Music at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
<p>Hailed as "a deft, smooth flute soloist" by the New York Times, Jennifer Grim's remarkable depth and breadth as a performer of solo and chamber repertoire is gaining broad national acclaim. First prize winner in several national chamber music competitions, Ms. Grim has performed with such groups as the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble. She is the flutist of the award-winning Z&eacute;phyros Winds, as well as the solo flutist of the New York Chamber Soloists and the principal flutist of the Vermont Mozart Festival. Other solo appearances include the Caramoor, Aspen, Norfolk, and Skaneateles Chamber Music Festivals.
<p>A passionate advocate of contemporary music in addition to the standard repertoire, Ms. Grim has performed with some of the leading contemporary groups in New York City, including Speculum Musicae, Manhattan Sinfonietta, ensemble 21 and Sequitur. In a June 2008 review of Speculum Musicae's performance of Elliot Carter's Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord, the NYT noted the "assured, polished, and beautifully nuanced" performances of Ms. Grim and her fellow musicians, remarking that "Nothing about [the piece] seemed daunting to these musicians, so the salient feature of the reading was not the work's difficulty but the contrast between its neo-Classical surface and its prickly harmonic underpinning."
<p>Ms. Grim has performed at Carnegie's Weill Recital Hall, for a sold-out New York debut concert of the award-winning contemporary ensemble Proteus, of which she was a founding member, as well as making an appearance at Lincoln Center presented by Great Performances. She also recently played in an acclaimed performance of Brian Ferneyhough's Superscriptio for solo piccolo at the Yale Center for British Art, for which the composer was in attendance.
<p>Ms. Grim has given master classes across the country, specializing in both solo and chamber music. Among the institutions at which she has appeared are the Juilliard School, Yale University, University of Iowa, University of Oregon, University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and the Idyllwild Arts Academy.
