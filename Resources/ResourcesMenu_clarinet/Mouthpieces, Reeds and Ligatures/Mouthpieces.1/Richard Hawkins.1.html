<h1>Richard Hawkins</h1>


<h3>R, B, Standard, Student </h3>
<p>The R is a highly recommended mouthpiece. It is a project to 
capture the qualities of the Caspar and Chedeville mouthpieces. It has 
a dark yet brilliant quality of sound and is an all around great mouthpiece. 
I played on this for many years and is one of my finest mouthpieces. 
The B is the version of the Chedeville mouthpiece. It has the quality 
of being clear, focused and ringy. The Standard is the original version 
of the Hawkins mouthpiece that has developed over the years and is a 
very good basic mouthpiece.</p>
