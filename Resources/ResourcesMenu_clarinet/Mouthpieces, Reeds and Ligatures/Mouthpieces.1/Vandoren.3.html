<h1>Vandoren Mouthpieces</h2>

<h3>M15, M30, 5RV, 5RV lyre, B46, 
B40, B40 lyre, B45, B45 lyre </h3>

<p>Vandoren offers truly extensive 
line of mouthpieces. They range from the very close facing to very open. 
They are all very solid mouthpieces that have a variety of different 
colors and ring qualities. The ones I recommend are the M series mouthpieces 
and the 5RV series. </p>
