 <h1>Rico</h1>


<p>Rico Royal - These reeds are 
very basic. They are your standard Rico reed great for students and 
intermediate players. </p>
<p>Rico Reserve - The Rico Reserve are currently my reeds of choice. 
They tend to play right away and have nice response and nice ring. 
Lots of vibration with a dark sound quality.</p>
