<h1>Rovner Eddie Daniels II Bb Clarinet Ligature and Cap Set</h1>

<p>
The Rovner ligature is a classic company. This Ligature is a great one 
for its reliability. There are a couple of different ways to alter the 
sound of the reed with the ligature and with that variety comes flexibility. 
Highly recommended. </p>
