<h1>Bonade Bb Clarinet Ligature</h1>

<p>
Known as a standard for ligatures, the Bonade ligature provides excellent 
sound and control. Choose from standard or inverted designs. The standard 
traditional one has a very focused sound. The reed will vibrate and 
hold. It can be a bit brighter and is great for projection and focus. 
The inverted one is recommended for a sound that is still focused and 
vibrant yet covered. </p>
