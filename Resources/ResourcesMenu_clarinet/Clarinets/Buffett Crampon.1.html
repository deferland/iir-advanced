<h1>Buffett Crampon</h1>

<h3>Tosca </h3>
<p>
One of Buffet's newest offerings and is recommended for its warmer singing tone and projection. Made in Grenadilla wood or Green line material, this clarinet is a composite of different materials that holds in colder conditions. The Tosca clarinet is available in Bb and A.</p>

<h3>Festival </h3>
<p>This clarinet belongs to the R13 bore family and has a rich tone. 
Similar to the R13 but some have a warmer tone. A very flexible clarinet 
that is easy to blow and fun to play in my opinion.</p>

<h3>Vintage  </h3>
<p>A new take on the 1950's R13's which were famous 
for their beautiful tone.<br>
The D/A and G#/C# tone holes have been raised</p>

<h3>RC Prestige </h3> 
<p>The body is in M&#39;Pingo wood. These clarinets are recommended for 
their rich beautiful sound.</p>

<h3>RC</h3> 
<p>Developed in 1975 
by the luthier Robert Carree, the RC clarinet has a sweeter sound. </p>

<h3>R13 Prestige </h3>
<p>A rich sound and is know for being a bit darker and richer than 
the R13.</p>

<h3>R13 </h3> 
<p>Developed in 1955 under the guidance of Robert Carree, 
the R13 clarinet is a standard choice of clarinetists all around the 
world. It is recommended for clarinetists looking for tradition and 
excellence with a focused ringy sound. Also available in 
green line. </p>
