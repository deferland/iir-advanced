<h1>Leblanc Clarinets</h1>

<h3>Legacy</h3> 
<p>One of Leblanc's newest ventures, this clarinet model was designed 
by Morrie Backun. The Legacy features a grenadilla wood body and comes 
with Backun traditional barrels and bells in both cocobolo and grenadilla. 
This is recommended for the clarinetist looking for something fresh. 
It has a combination of projection and warmth with a unique resonant 
tone. It is important to try various combinations of barrels and bells 
if possible as they may change the sound. </p>

<h3>Symphonie</h3> 
<p>This clarinet is similar to the Legacy also designed by Backun. 
It is a very flexible clarinet that has a more traditional sound character.</p>

<h3>Concerto II</h3>
 <p>Recommended for its colorful sound and ease of play it is a clarinet 
that bridges old and new.</p>

<h3>Opus II</h3> 
<p>The Opus II is known for its beautiful tone, its hold in the louder 
dynamics and ease of play.</p>
