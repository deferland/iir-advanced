<h1> Bb Student Trumpets</h1>
<p>Starting on a quality instrument is 
important for trumpet players. Finding success in the first year 
of playing is essential to long term development and establishment of 
basic playing technique. It is important that students find an 
instrument that will allow proper playing. Just as important is 
a well made instrument that is sturdy and can withstand the day to day 
riggers of young students.</p>
<p>Below are some of the more popular 
beginning trumpet choices available. These trumpets are all made 
with young students in mind and are suitable for their first years of 
playing. Many of these products are sold with starter kits including 
cleaning and maintenance items that are needed on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>NOTE: It is NOT recommended that 
you should ever purchase a cheap trumpet from a supercenter or wholesale 
warehouse. These instruments are made overseas from the cheapest 
materials possible and often break within the first year if not the 
first few months. They are also nearly impossible to tune properly 
with an ensemble and delay your student's musical development.</p>
