<h1> Schilke Mouthpieces</h1>
<p>Renold Otto Schilke, a former trumpet 
player with the Chicago Symphony orchestra, started the Schilke company 
in 1956. As a boy, he was a member of the Holton factory band 
and grew up learning the art of music instrument manufacturing. 
By age 17, Schilke was making his own mouthpieces.</p>
<p>Although not as widely used as Bach, 
Schilke mouthpieces are very popular with many professional players 
and are known for their high quality and excellent design.</p>

<h3>11</h3>
  <p>A superior mouthpiece with standard 
  characteristics for a free blowing mouthpiece; closest to the Bach 7C 
  and popular for young players</p>

<h3>13</h3>
  <p>Ideal choice for a student or developing 
  player with standard #3 rim contour. Rounder rim provides increased 
  flexibility and quick response. "C" cup offers volume for tone; 
  more cushioned rim, close to a Bach 5C - more advanced</p>

<h3>13C4</h3>
  <p>A somewhat sharp inner-edge combined 
  with a funnel-shaped &quot;C&quot; cup offers a clear tone. The #4 semi-flat 
  rim adds increased endurance</p>

<h3>14</h3>
  <p>With a standard rim, cup and backbore, 
  the 14 is an excellent choice for all around playing; a Bach 1  C 
  player might like this one</p>

<h3>16C4</h3>
  <p>Similar to the 16 in dimensions, this 
  mouthpiece offers a semi-flat rim for a more traditional feel and increased 
  endurance; most similar feel to a Bach 1  C</p>

<h3>17</h3>
  <p>A compromise of all the medium characteristics, 
  this mouthpiece is an excellent medium to large diameter mouthpiece; 
  similar to a Bach 1  C</p>

<h3>18</h3>
  <p>The high point being nearer to the 
  center makes this mouthpiece feel smaller than it is. The standard characteristics 
  produce a rich, brilliant tone; similar to a Bach 1  C</p>

<h3>12B4</h3>
  <p>This medium-small conical &quot;B&quot; 
  cup provides a full tone and the semi-flat rim allows for more endurance; 
  this bigger diameter and shallower cup is close to a Bach 6D</p>
