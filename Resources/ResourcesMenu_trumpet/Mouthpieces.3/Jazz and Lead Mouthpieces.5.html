<h1> Jazz/Lead 
Mouthpieces</h1>

<p>Any mouthpiece can be used 
for jazz, but certain mouthpieces are preferred by commercial or lead 
players. These mouthpieces&#39; smaller diameter sizes and shallower cups 
make it easier to play in the upper register and also to &#39;cut&#39; through 
with a brighter tone. </p>
<p>Note: These pieces will improve 
the upper register but aren&#39;t a simple solution to range issues. I would 
caution a beginning student about using these mouthpieces regularly, 
as they can possibly make the lower registers less full or give them 
a very bright or edgy sound</p>
