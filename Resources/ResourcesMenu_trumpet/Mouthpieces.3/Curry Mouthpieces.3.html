<h1> Curry Mouthpieces</h1>
<p>Mark Curry lives in Reno, NV 
and produces his own line of mouthpieces. The curry mouthpieces 
correspond to the Bach sizes. However, they also have a &quot;BC&quot; 
series, which is a Bach &quot;c&quot; rim with a Bach &quot;b&quot; 
underpart. There are many with deeper cups as well as shallower 
cups, but the following would be the most standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.25BC</li>
<li>1.25C</li>
<li>3BC</li>
<li>3C</li>
<li>5BC</li>
<li>5C</li>
<li>7BC</li>
<li>7C</li>
</ul>
