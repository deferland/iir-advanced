<h1> Giddings 
&amp; Webster</h1>

<p>Ivan Giddings has his masters in tuba 
performance from Pennsylvania State University, and is a tuba teacher 
and performer by trade. Robert Webster has been working as a machinist 
and a toolmaker for over thirty years. Bob and Ivan met in November 
2000, each with their first prototype stainless steel mouthpieces. They 
were impressed with what the other could do, and the Giddings &amp; 
Webster collaboration began.</p>
<p>I have working with Giddings 
and Webster in collaboration to develop my own mouthpiece. Please 
read below about their line of trumpet mouthpieces.</p>

  and deep cup for a powerful sound, a good choice for orchestra and large

<h3>7 GW 144</h3>

  7C!</p>

<h3>Matthew Muckey</h3>
