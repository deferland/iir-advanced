<h1>Bach Mouthpieces</h1>

<p>Vincent Bach combined his unique talents 
as both a musician and an engineer to create brass instruments which 
remain the sound choice of artists worldwide. As a trumpet player 
on tour in Pittsburgh, a repairman convinced Vincent that he could improve 
his mouthpiece. After ruining the mouthpiece, Vincent experienced difficulty 
in finding a suitable replacement. He then recognized the need by brass 
players for high-quality mouthpieces. He began making and selling 
his line of mouthpieces in 1918.</p>
<p>Bach mouthpieces are the most popular 
mouthpieces in the world used by beginners and professionals alike. 
Like trumpets, its always a good idea to try out various mouthpieces 
for extended playing sessions before making any final decisions on what 
might be the best mouthpiece for you. Below are some of the most 
common Bach mouthpieces used by trumpet players.</p>

players, compact tone of great carrying power for a symphonic sound</p>
