	<h1>Bore Sizes</h1> 
	<p>Trumpets will come with different sized bores that can affect how the horn sounds and feels.  A smaller bore size will be easier to play, but won&#x27;t have the same breadth of sound that a large bore has.  A large bore might have a big sound, but the soft and delicate playing will be more difficult to achieve.  I play on a medium large bore trumpet, because I like the sound but it also has lots of flexibility and good softs.</p>
