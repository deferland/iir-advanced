	<h1>Silver vs. Brass</h1> 
	<p>Most student instruments come stock in brass.  Trumpets also come in silver or gold plating.  The different plating gives the instrument a different sound and feel.  Silver plating will give the trumpet a more brilliant and bright sound, while gold plating will warm the sound.  Personally, I recommend brass or silver plating to younger students, because gold plating is more expensive and most people won't notice the sound difference. </p>
