	<h1>Mouthpiece Info</h1> 
	<p>A standard mouthpiece for a beginning trumpeter is a Bach 7c. However, you may want to try a different sized mouthpiece, as there are countless varieties.  When looking for a new mouthpiece, keep in mind that every player has different sized lips and strength abilities.  In general, a bigger mouthpiece will warm and darken the sound.  For Bach mouthpieces, the lower numbers mean a larger rim diameter.  A bigger mouthpiece might better suit a more advanced player, as it takes more strength and stamina to play a larger rim.  A smaller mouthpiece might help a student play higher, but possibly at the cost of sacrificing tone quality and warmth of sound.  It is ideal to find a balance between ease of playing and sound.  The letter after the number refers to the shape of the cup.  A "C" cup will have a different depth and feel to it then a "B" cup (which has a more funnel shape).</p>
