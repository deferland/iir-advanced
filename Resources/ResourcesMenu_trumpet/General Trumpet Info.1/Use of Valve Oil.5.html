	<h1>Use of Valve Oil</h1> 
	<p>It is important oil your valves every day to keep your trumpet finely tuned and in good working condition.  Neglect of oiling the valves can result in them "sticking" during a concert, which is not a very nice sound!  In the long term, using valve oil will keep the valves safe from unnecessary wear and tear. </p>
