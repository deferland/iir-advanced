<h1>Straight Mutes</h1>
<p>The straight mute is the most 
commonly used mute. Straight mutes are designed with a variety of different 
materials, but the most common are aluminum, brass, or copper. For a 
softer sound, mutes can be made out of plastic, cardboard, or wood. 
Every material influences the sound of the mute differently, so try 
different mutes to see which one fits the sound you are looking for.
In the orchestra, we generally play aluminum straight mute for ordinary 
playing, a copper-bottom straight mute for loud playing, and a cardboard 
or wood mute for the softer, more delicate playing.</p>

manufacturers for trumpet:</p>
