<h1> Practice mutes</h1>
<p>In quiet apartments or hotels, 
the sound of a loud trumpet can be somewhat unwelcome. Thankfully, there 
are a variety of mutes that can drastically dampen the sound of the 
trumpet. However, be careful when playing with practice mutes, because 
they constrict your ability to blow freely. Too much practicing on these 
mutes can be deconstructive, as the excess backpressure can cause you 
to develop some bad habits. However, if there is no other option, I 
highly recommend these mutes.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best practice 
mute manufacturers for trumpet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yamaha</li>
<li>Trumcor</li>
<li>Dennis Wick</li>
</ul>
