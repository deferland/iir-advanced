<h1>Shires Trombones</h1>

<p>Shires makes a very high quality professional 
instrument. Steve Shires, the designer of the instrument, worked for 
Edwards before creating his own company. Although Shires and Edwards 
are different instruments, there are many similarities in design and 
playability. Shires have become increasingly popular over the last ten 
years with orchestral players in the United States. Shires instruments 
can be purchased at a limited number of retail stores. You can also 
visit their website at <a href="http://www.seshires.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" ><u>www.seshires.com</u></font></a>. If you are interested in purchasing a Shires 
trombone, I would highly recommend scheduling an appointment to visit 
their factory outside of Boston. Since Shires trombones are customized, 
it&#39;s best to go to the factory so that you may try the many options 
that they have available.</p>
