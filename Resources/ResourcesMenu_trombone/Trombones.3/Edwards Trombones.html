<h1>Edwards Trombones</h1>
<p>Edwards Instruments is a custom maker 
based out of Elkhorn, Wisconson. You can order their instruments through 
their website at <a href="http://www.edwards-instruments.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" ><u>www.edwards-instruments.com</u></font></a> or by visiting their shop in Elkhorn. I have 
performed exclusively on Edwards trombones for the last 7 years and 
can attest to the very high quality of their products. One of the best 
things about Edwards is the consistency in the quality of their product. </p>
<p>For many years now, Edwards has been 
the choice of many orchestral trombone players. Edwards trombones are 
custom made and are geared towards advanced/professional players. Their 
instruments are played by musicians in many of the world&#39;s leading ensembles 
including the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, New York Philharmonic and 
Philadelphia Orchestra. I give Edwards my highest recommendation. </p>
<p>The options available by Edwards is too 
large to list here. The best way to get an understanding of their available 
equipment is to visit their website or go to the factory. I would recommend 
a variation of the T350-E model.</p>
