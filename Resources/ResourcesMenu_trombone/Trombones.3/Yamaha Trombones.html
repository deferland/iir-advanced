<h1>Yamaha Trombones</h1>

<p>Yamaha is an instrument maker based out 
of Japan. Many successful artists perform on their instruments, including 
some members of the Vienna Philharmonic, Boston Symphony and Seattle 
Symphony. Yamaha instruments have long been known for their ease of 
response and vibration. Yamaha is also a brand that is very popular 
with beginners. They make very good student model instruments. In my 
opinion, Yamaha is a company that seems to be consistently improving 
their product.</p>
<p>Yamaha instruments are available through 
retail stores and are very reasonably priced, especially compared to 
Edwards and Shires. In my opinion, the new Yamaha Xeno is the best professional 
tenor trombone that Yamaha has produced, and many high level players 
are fans of this instrument.</p>
