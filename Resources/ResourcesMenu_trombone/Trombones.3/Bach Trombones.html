<h1>Bach Trombones</h1>

<p>Bach is one of the most popular trombone 
brands in the world. They make a wide range of instruments for all levels 
of playing. Bach is the chosen brand of many professional players including 
artists in the Chicago and San Francisco Symphonies.</p>
<p>Bach instruments are less costly than 
Edwards and Shires, but also are a little less consistent from instrument 
to instrument. Unfortunately, not all Bach trombones play the same. 
Bach instruments are sold in retail stores all around the country. While 
I do recommend these instruments to students and professionals alike, 
I would HIGHLY recommend thoroughly trying out and comparing Bach instruments 
before committing to a particular instrument.</p>
