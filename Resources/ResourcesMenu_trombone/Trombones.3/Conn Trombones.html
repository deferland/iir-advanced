<h1>Conn Trombones</h1>


<p>Conn is probably the oldest recognizable 
name in American trombone making. The company was based out of Elkhart, 
Indiana. In the 70&#39;s, Conn trombones were the primary instruments of 
choice for most orchestral trombonists, and they continue to be popular 
today all over the world. Christian Lindberg, perhaps the most recognizable 
name in the trombone industry is a Conn artist. The 88H is the most 
popular professional instrument made by Conn.</p>
