<p>This instrument review should serve only 
as an explanation of available options. All instruments that are listed 
here are instruments that I would recommend to my students. While I 
believe that any of the instruments here can help you attain your goals, 
please make every effort to try out an instrument before making a purchase. 
Although it is sometimes necessary, it is never advisable to purchase 
an instrument without having the opportunity to play it first. Every 
player is different in his/her needs or desires. What works for one 
does not work for all.</p>
<p>Some instrument companies, such as Courtois, 
Rath, B&amp;S, and Thein have been left off of this list. While those 
companies all make very high quality instruments, they have yet to gain 
significant footing in the American market. Therefore, for the time 
being, they will not be reviewed here. I would recommend that the more 
advanced player explore these options as well. That said, I hope that 
this guide will be helpful in selecting an instrument.</p>
