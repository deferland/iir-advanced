	<h1>Bore Sizes</h1> 
	<p>
	The bore size of instrument tells you the diameter of the receiver where you will place the mouthpiece. The larger the bore, the wider the receiver opening. In the trombone world there are many different bore sizes, and it is important that you know the terminology and what these instruments are used for.  </p>
	<h4>.500 Bore</h4>
	<p> This bore size typically refers to a &quot;peashooter&quot; or &quot;small bore&quot; instrument. This bore size is common for professional jazz instruments. It is also the popular bore size for beginning trombonists. I would recommend a .500 bore instrument to a beginner. </p> 

<h4>.525 Bore</h4>
	<p> This bore size is typically referred to as a &quot;medium bore&quot; instrument. These instruments serve a few different functions. Some people like to use these instruments as a transition instrument between .500 and .547 trombones. Some like to use these instruments to play parts that require the player to play with a slightly lighter sound than a .547 instrument will provide. A common example of this is the Bach 36.  </p>
	
	<h4>.547 Bore</h4>
	<p> This bore size is typically referred to as a &quot;large bore&quot; instrument. This size is the most common amongst players from high school all the way through the professional ranks. I would recommend upgrading to a large bore horn after you feel like you have outgrown the .500 small bore instrument. In most cases there is no need to transition to a .525 instrument first. The majority of professional players in orchestras, military bands, etc. play instruments that are this size.</p>  
	<h4>.562 Bore</h4>
	<p>This bore size is for bass trombones.
