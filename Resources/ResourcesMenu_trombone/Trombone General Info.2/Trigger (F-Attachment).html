	<h1>Trigger (F-Attachment)</h1> 
	<p>
		The trigger / F-attachment is something I would recommend that you get after upgrading from a student model instrument.</p>
		<p> The F-attachment helps the player facilitate technically difficult passages that would otherwise use too many long positions. It also gives the player access to several lower register notes that are difficult to produce clearly on a straight (no trigger) instrument. When the player pulls the trigger, a valve is opened that sends the air through additional tubing, thus changing the key of the instrument from Bb to F.</p>
		<p>There are many different types of valves on the market. For a long time, the rotary valve was the standard valve used. Over the last 15 years or so, the Thayer/Axial Flow valve has become very popular as well. I currently play, and recommend, the Thayer valve, but there are many high quality valve systems on the market and you should try several of them to help decide what is best for you. </p>
