	<h1>Large Shank Mouthpieces</h1> 
	<p class="subheading">(for advanced players/large bore trombones)</p>

	<p>Large shank mouthpieces will fit into large bore trombones (.547 bore). These mouthpieces are the standard for the most high school, university and professional players. The most popular large bore mouthpieces are made by custom makers. In general, the size of a custom mouthpiece is referred to by how it would compare to the size of a Vincent Bach mouthpiece. Most custom makers have their own numbering system for mouthpieces, but often times have a comparison chart that references Vincent Bach mouthpieces. For the purpose of this review, I will list/review the different sizes of Vincent Bach mouthpieces and then give a review of custom mouthpiece makers I would recommend.  </p>

	<p>There are a few things to mention about choosing an appropriate mouthpiece. In general, as the cup of the mouthpiece gets larger, the sound of the instrument will also become larger. Larger cup sizes require greater endurance and breath control to manage the sound. The diameter of the rim should bear some relation to the lip size of the player. Often times, players with larger lips feel more comfortable on rims with wider diameters. In my opinion, it is important to find a mouthpiece that aids you in producing a sound that is clear and free of impurities. The size of the sound is secondary in importance to the purity of the sound.</p>
	
	<h4>Vincent Bach 5G</h4> 
	<p>This mouthpiece has long been considered the default mouthpiece for trombonist. Just about everything about this mouthpiece is considered to be pretty standard, from the diameter of the rim to the depth of the cup. This a versatile mouthpiece and is used by many high level trombonists.  </p>
	<h4>Vincent Bach 4G</h4> 
	<p>This mouthpiece is similar to the 5G in many respects. The rim and cup are slightly larger. The tone of this mouthpiece is slightly wider/broader than that of the 5G. I would recommend a mouthpiece of this size for players with larger lips and/or a stronger embouchure.  </p>

	<h4>Doug Elliott Mouthpieces</h4> 
	<p>Doug Elliot is a custom mouthpiece maker based out of Washington, DC. His mouthpieces are known for their high level of consistency and clarity. A staple of Doug Elliott mouthpieces are that the rim, shank and cup all screw apart. This allows players to switch components quickly and easily to adjust to the demands of the music they are playing. Doug's mouthpieces come in a variety of shapes, sizes and finishes. He is also flexible when it comes to designing something to fit your specific needs. </p>

	<h4>Greg Black Mouthpieces</h4> 
	<p>I perform on Greg Black mouthpieces and I highly recommend them.  Greg is a custom mouthpiece maker based out of New Jersey. His mouthpieces are known for the core consistency of sound. Members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, New York Philharmonic and many others are often seen performing on his mouthpieces. </p>
	<h4>Griego Mouthpieces</h4> 
	<p>Griego mouthpieces are relatively new to the market. Christan Griego is the designer of Edwards trombones and has recently released his new line of mouthpieces. Over the last year, these mouthpieces have become increasingly popular amongst high level players. </p>
