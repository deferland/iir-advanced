	<h1>Small Shank Mouthpieces</h1> 
	<p class="subheading">(for beginners/small bore trombones)</p>

	<p>Small shank mouthpieces will fit into most beginner/small bore trombones. Make sure when purchasing a trombone mouthpiece that the shank of the mouthpiece matches in size with the mouthpiece receiver of the instrument. The following mouthpieces are good for beginning students. I would recommend that a student use the following mouthpieces for the first one or two years of playing.  </p>

	<h4>Bach 6 1/2 AL or 6 1/2 A</h4>

	<p>These mouthpieces are both very good for beginning trombone players. Vincent Bach mouthpieces have been the standard for years. These mouthpieces are reasonably prices and are pretty well suited to most young players. The rim and the cup of the mouthpiece are large enough that the student can produce a full bodied tone, but not so large that control is difficult. This is the mouthpiece I would recommend to most beginners.  </p>
	
	<h4>Bach 5G</h4> 
	<p>This mouthpiece is slightly larger than the 6 1/2 A(L). This is good for the student who feels that he/she has perhaps outgrown the 6 1/2 A(L). This mouthpiece is very versatile. In fact, in the large shank version, it is used by many symphonic professionals. I would recommend this mouthpiece to beginners who have full shaped lips or are slightly more advanced.  </p>
	<h4>Bach 7C, 11C and 12C</h4> 
	<p>These mouthpieces are a fair amount smaller than the 5G and 6 1/2 A(L). As the number gets higher, the size of the mouthpiece gets smaller. I would recommend these mouthpieces to students who feel that the larger mouthpieces are too difficult to control. These mouthpieces are also recommended to students who are pursuing jazz studies more than classical studies.
