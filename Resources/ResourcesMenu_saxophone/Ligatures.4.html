	<h1>Ligatures</h1>
	<p>
	While the ligature does not have as large an influence on a saxophonist's sound as does the reed, mouthpiece, and instrument selection, it does nonetheless have the ability to affect the tone, articulation, and response. As such, it is often times the most overlooked piece of equipment for the developing saxophonist.</p>
	<p>
	Ligatures come in varying designs and materials. Many ligatures have the screws on the bottom, while inverted ligatures have the screws on the top. Ligatures can be made of metal (some with platings such as gold or silver), leather, plastic, or string, and some models include a combination of these materials. Ligatures also offer a variety of systems by which contact is made with the reed, and by which the reed is held onto the mouthpiece.</p>
	
<p>	Often, an inexpensive ‘stock’ ligature will come with a student-level horn or mouthpiece. These no-name brands generally do not allow the reed to vibrate as freely and uniformly as it should, and can tend to hold a reed unevenly.  This can make the instrument’s scale more uneven, the articulation difficult, or the response labored, particularly in the low range.  A good ligature, on the other hand, can help enrich the sound throughout the range of the horn, as well as allow for easier articulation.
</p>	<p>I recommend upgrading from the stock ligature as early as possible. Below is a list of some ligatures to consider. As with mouthpieces and reeds, try as many as you can before settling on one. What may work on one mouthpiece may not work on another quite as well. And, as different ligatures bring out different characteristics in your sound, you may find that some work better for classical music or playing in a concert band setting, while others work better when you are striving for a jazz tone. 
</p>	<p>When choosing a ligature, also keep in mind that metal mouthpieces are smaller in diameter than their hard rubber counterparts. You’ll want to make sure that the ligature fits your brand of mouthpiece before ordering one. 
	</p><h3>Bay</h3><p>	Inverted ligatures made of very thin metal, with gold or silver plating. The Bay ligature with gold plating is my personal choice for a classical alto setup, as I find it provides a nice balance between response, evenness, and warmth.
</p>	<h3>BG</h3>	<p>BG makes great ligatures as well, and has a few models. I recommend either the “Traditional”, which is an inverted metal ligature with a single-screw design, or the “Revelation”, which is a leather ligature with ribbed metal against the reed. The gold-plated versions of these ligatures provide for an even richer tone.  I personally use the BG Traditional (gold plated) on my classical soprano and tenor setups .</p>
	<h3>Brancher</h3>	<p>The Brancher “Leggiero” model features an inverted single-screw design, with two light metal rails connecting the screw to the plate which holds the reed. This is a very responsive ligature which allows a nice core to the sound, which I use on baritone saxophone.</p>
	<h3>Vandoren</h3>	<p>Vandoren’s “Optimum” gold-gilded metal ligature features a single-screw design with 3 interchangeable plates which provide for different tonal options.</p>
	<h3>Rovner</h3>	<p>Rovner’s ligatures include the “Dark” and the “Light”, which cover the reed and mouthpiece in leather and emphasize the lower partials in the sound.  Rovner’s “Eddie Daniels” model (or “Versa”) features a leather ligature with interchangeable metal plates which hold the reed. I have enjoyed using the “Eddie Daniels” model on soprano saxophone.</p>
	<h3>Francois Louis</h3> <p>Francois Louis ligatures use a system of small cylinders against the mouthpiece, held together by light metal wire, allowing the reed to vibrate very freely. FL ligatures have been particularly popular among jazz saxophonists, on both metal and hard rubber mouthpieces, and I personally have used these on both my classical and jazz setups.</p>
	<h3>Oleg</h3>	<p>Oleg’s “Olegature” is an inverted single-screw ligature, and secures the reed to the mouthpiece with a flexible gold-plated metal mesh.</p>
	<h3>Bonade</h3> <p>A metal ligature which makes contact with the reed via two parallel metal rails. Available in standard and inverted models. I use the inverted model on my jazz alto mouthpieces.</p>
	<h3>Harrison</h3>	<p>An inverted metal ligature which holds the reed in place via a plate shaped roughly in an “H”.</p>
	<h3>Selmer</h3>	<p>Selmer’s ligature is one of the better stock ligatures available.  It is a traditional metal ligature with two screws on the bottom.</p>
