<h1>Jazz Reeds</h1>
<p>There is a quite a bit of variety in 
commonly-used jazz reeds. Professionals may use one brand of reed on 
one instrument or mouthpiece, and a different brand on a different setup. 
As a general rule, you want to find a reed that is relatively free-blowing 
and provides a full sound for jazz ensemble work, while not being too 
edgy. The following list is a good starting point for reeds to consider 
on a jazz mouthpiece. As you work on improving your tone, experiment 
with different brands and strengths of reeds until you find one that 
works well with your setup.</p>
