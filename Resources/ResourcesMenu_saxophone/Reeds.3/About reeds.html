<h1>Reed Information</h1>

<p>The reed is in many ways the heart 
of the saxophone. You may have a terrific saxophone and mouthpiece, 
but with an inadequate reed, you will find your sound and response to 
be lacking. Reed selection is also a very personal choice, and depends 
on the type of mouthpiece you play, the sound you are seeking as a player, 
and the particulars of your embouchure.</p>
<h3>Cut</h3>

<p>Reeds can be grouped into two general 
categories, depending on their cut: French or American. Reeds with an 
American cut have a U-shaped cut to separate the bark from the vamp 
of the reed. These reeds are more often selected for jazz playing. A French cut reed features a straight cut at the top of the bark (in the middle of the reed); these reeds are more often selected for classical 
playing.</p>

<h3>Strength</h3>

<p>Each manufacturer sells varying strengths 
of reeds, which gives the saxophonist an indication as to the softness 
or hardness of the reed. Some manufacturers use a numbering system 
(2, 2.5, 3, etc), and some use a lettering system (S for soft, M for 
medium, MH for medium hard, etc), while some combine the two systems 
(3S, 3M, etc). I recommend trying a variety of brands and 
strengths until you find what works well for you. As a general rule, 
the more closed your mouthpiece, the stiffer the reed you will need 
to use; the converse is also true. In other words, if you play a #3 
reed on a medium-opening mouthpiece (a Selmer C* for instance), you 
would probably use a #2.5 on a mouthpiece with a larger tip opening 
(like a Selmer E). I suggest that beginning saxophonists start  
with a #2 or #2.5 strength reed on a mouthpiece with a medium facing, 
and as your embouchure develops, move up to a #3 or #3.5. However, be 
careful not to fall into the mindset that the more advanced you become, 
the harder your reed should become. Your strength of reed should 
just be determined by what ultimately helps you produce the best sound, 
ease of response, articulation, and evenness of tone.</p>
