<h1>JAZZ MOUTHPIECES</h1>
<p>There are many models of jazz mouthpieces 
on the market today, which help saxophonists in the quest for their 
personal sound. And as when choosing a classical mouthpiece, selecting 
a good jazz mouthpiece is critical; many players would agree that the 
mouthpiece and reed combination is actually the most important part 
of the saxophone, as it has the largest influence over our tone, intonation, 
articulation, and response.</p>
<p>Jazz saxophone mouthpieces are most 
often made of hard rubber or metal, while a few specialty models are 
made of wood. Keep in mind however that the tone is more influenced 
by the cut of the mouthpiece - the tip opening, the length of the 
lay or facing, and the baffle and chamber - than by the material itself. 
I recommend that young saxophonists begin with medium-opening hard rubber 
mouthpieces (for instance, the hard rubber Meyer 5M is a great place 
to start for alto players), which will serve them well in many situations.</p>
<p>The list below should be considered a introduction to mouthpieces that are good
 for jazz and pop music, whether in 
a jazz ensemble, combo, or band. I have also included some notes about sizes to consider, 
or if I recommend the mouthpiece for a particular saxophone. 
Different mouthpiece manufacturers have differing measurement systems, 
so it is helpful to refer to a mouthpiece comparison chart to find mouthpieces 
of similar sizes. And as with all mouthpieces, it is important to try 
a few when making a purchase. Even identical mouthpieces of the same 
make and size can still be quite different from one another.</p>
