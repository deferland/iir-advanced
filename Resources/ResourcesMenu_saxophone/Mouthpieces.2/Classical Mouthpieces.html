<h1>CLASSICAL MOUTHPIECES</h1>
<p>Choosing a good mouthpiece is critical 
for saxophonists. Many players would agree that the mouthpiece and reed 
combination is actually the most important part of the saxophone, as 
it has the largest influence over our tone, intonation, articulation, 
and response.</p>
<p>The mouthpieces listed below are all 
good for classical playing, working in concert band and wind ensemble 
settings, or playing in quartets and mixed chamber ensembles. I also 
recommend that the beginning saxophonist choose from the list below 
even when working in the jazz style. As you become more advanced and 
your embouchure becomes more developed, then add a jazz mouthpiece to 
your collection.</p>
<p>The majority of classical saxophone 
mouthpieces are made of hard rubber (ebonite). Different mouthpiece 
manufacturers have differing measurement systems, but most refer to 
the tip opening, the length of the lay or facing, and the size of the 
chamber. The shape of the chamber (as you look through the back of the 
mouthpiece) also affects the tone; some are round, others square, while 
others are combination of those, and are shaped like a horseshoe.</p>
<p>And while these mouthpieces can be 
generally categorized in terms of darkness or brightness of sound, keep 
in mind that it is primarily the saxophonist that determines the tone, 
by way of their embouchure, voicing, airstream, reed selection, and 
inherent tonal concept.</p>
<p>As with all mouthpieces, it is important 
to try a few when making a purchase. Even identical mouthpieces of the 
same make and size can still be quite different from one another.</p>

<h3>Selmer</h3>
<h4>Model S80 Size: C*</h4>
<p>The Selmer S80 has long been one of 
the most commonly-used classical mouthpieces, with the C* being the 
standard facing. Professionals and students alike appreciate its ease 
of response, round and centered sound, and even scale.</p>

<h4>Model: S90 Size: 180 or 190</h4>
<p>Selmer&#39;s more recent addition to their 
mouthpiece line, the S90 is similar to the S80 but with perhaps a bit 
more brilliance and definition to the tone. My personal choice is the 
Selmer S90.</p>

<h3>Vandoren</h3>
<h4>Model: Optimum Size: AL3 (alto)</h4>
<p>Vandoren Optimum mouthpieces have 
round chambers, and feature ease of response and articulation with a 
round, warm sound. Another great option for beginners as well 
as advanced players.</p>

<h4>V5 Model: A17, A27 (alto)</h4>
<p>The V5 series has a different color 
spectrum than the Optimum series, with the V5 having perhaps more breadth 
and complexity of tone. While I don&#39;t recommend these for those 
just beginning, they are played with great success by top professionals 
and advanced students around the world.</p>

<h3>Rousseau</h3>
<h4>Model: NC4, 4R </h4>
<p>These mouthpieces blow easily with 
a smooth tone, and tend towards the darker end of the spectrum.</p>

<h3>Caravan</font></h3>
<p>A large, round chamber mouthpiece 
that emphasizes the lower partials in the tonal spectrum. These mouthpieces 
have more resistance than some of the other mouthpieces listed above. </p>

<h3>Morgan</h3>
<h4>Model: Excalibur</h4>
<p>Another large, round chamber mouthpiece,  but more free-blowing than a Caravan.</p>

<h3>Yamaha</h3>
<h4>Model: 4C (student)</h4>
<p>A passable entry-level mouthpiece 
that is less expensive than those listed above. </p>
