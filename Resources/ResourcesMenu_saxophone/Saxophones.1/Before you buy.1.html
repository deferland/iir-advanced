<h1>Overview</u></h1>
<p>There are dozens of saxophone manufacturers 
producing instruments today, and when shopping for a saxophone it can 
be a bit daunting to know where to begin, particularly for the first-time 
buyer. I have included some recommendations when looking for a student, 
intermediate, or professional level saxophone. There are a few important 
things to keep in mind, for any saxophonist. First, treat your instrument 
with great care, and have it serviced by a professional repairperson 
regularly. All saxophones go out of adjustment, leading to pad leaks 
and other issues which can make even professional instruments difficult 
to play. Second, while the choice of instrument is very important, the 
choice of a quality mouthpiece and reed combination will go equally 
far (if not farther) in determining your tone. And third, a great instrument 
will only be as good as the saxophonist playing it, so be sure to find 
a good teacher in your area from whom to take regular lessons.</p>
