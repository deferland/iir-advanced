<h1>Professional Saxophones</h1>
<p>Professional level saxophones represent 
the finest in quality and craftsmanship. These instruments are generally 
handmade, and have higher quality metal, pads, springs, posts, and other 
components. They also maintain their regulation better, leading 
to fewer leaks. Overall, these saxophones have richer, more beautiful 
sounds, and better intonation and evenness of tone throughout the range. 
Below is a list of recommended professional saxophones. My personal 
favorites include the Selmer Series III or Series II, or Yamaha Custom 
875. The Selmer Reference and Yamaha Custom Z saxophones are also very 
fine new instruments created specifically with an ear towards jazz and 
popular music.</p>
