<h1>Intermediate Saxophones</h1>
<p>Intermediate level instruments feature 
better workmanship than student line saxophones, and the components 
are generally of a higher quality. These saxophones also often include 
a better mouthpiece, a high F# key, brass keys, and more elaborate engraving.  
Their tone and intonation will be superior to student instruments as 
well. When purchasing an intermediate level saxophone, keep in 
mind that the price for a new intermediate instrument is often not far 
off from that of a used professional saxophone, so keep an eye out for 
used horns that are in good condition. My personal recommendations in 
this category are the Selmer La Voix or Yamaha YAS-475, or a used Yamaha 
52.</p>
