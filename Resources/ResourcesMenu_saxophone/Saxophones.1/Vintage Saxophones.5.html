<h1>Vintage Saxophones</h1>
<p>The saxophone has a rich and varied 
manufacturing tradition, and vintage instruments of all makes and models 
are available in the used marketplace. Varying makes of vintage 
instruments have distinct tonal characteristics - many players contend 
they are even more distinct from one to the other than modern instruments 
are - and some are more suitable for specific musical styles than 
others.</p>
<p>As a generalization, modern instruments 
tend to be a bit easier to play in terms of ergonomics, response, and 
intonation, than the saxophones from the 1930s and 1940s. I don&#39;t often 
recommend that my students start with a vintage instrument from that 
era, though the professional horns from the 1960&#39;s onwards would certainly 
be fine.  But professional saxophonists - particularly in the jazz, 
blues, and pop music genres - often use vintage instruments because 
of the unique sound those instruments embody.</p>
<p>Following is a list of some of the 
more common vintage saxophones used today.</p>

<h3>Selmer - Mark VI</h3>
<p>The Mark VI is undoubtedly the most 
popular vintage saxophone for jazz musicians today, and used by many 
classical and studio musicians as well. It was produced from 1954-1980, 
and most revered for the core and ring to its sound.</p>

<h3>Selmer - Mark VII</h3>
<p>The Mark VII was Selmer&#39;s model following 
the Mark VI. This was a heavier instrument with a larger bore, and while 
not nearly as successful as the Mark VI, still represents a fine (and 
less expensive) professional saxophone from the 1970&#39;s. Only alto 
and tenor Mark VII saxophones were widely produced. Mark VIIs were more 
accepted by classical musicians than jazz musicians, because of their 
darker and slightly tubbier sounds.</p>

<h3>Conn 6M (alto), 10M (tenor), 12M (baritone)</h3>
<p>Produced from the 1930&#39;s onwards, 
these Conns are particularly used for jazz and popular music. The 10M 
and 12M in particular are the ones still most used today, and all of 
Conn&#39;s instruments from this era have a warm, full-bodied sound, gutsy 
tone. Conns made before the 1960s are generally more desirable.</p>

<h3>King Super 20</h3>
<p>Another great saxophone primarily 
used by jazz musicians, and made famous by greats such as Cannonball 
Adderly and Johnny Griffin.</p>

<h3>Buescher -True Tone, Aristocrat, 400 (Top Hat and Cane)</h3>
<p>The Buescher Company produced great 
saxophones in the early- and mid-1900&#39;s, with heavy metal, dark tones, 
and solid workmanship. These are three models of vintage Buescher saxophones; 
their horns made before the 1960s are generally more desirable.</p>

<h3>Martin - Handcraft, Magna</h3>
<p>Fine saxophones from the 1930s-early 
1960s. The Martins are solid, heavy instruments, with traditionally 
warm sounds. Martins made before the mid 1960s are generally more desirable.</p>

<h3>Buffet - Super Dynaction, S1 Prestige</h3>
<p>Buffet is a French instrument manufacturer 
of fine clarinets and saxophones, among other instruments. In the saxophone 
world, Buffet was in many ways overshadowed by the more prominent Selmer 
company, but was known for high quality instruments with a brilliant 
tone. The S1 Prestige feature a copper body, which presents different 
tonal characteristics from a standard brass body.</p>
