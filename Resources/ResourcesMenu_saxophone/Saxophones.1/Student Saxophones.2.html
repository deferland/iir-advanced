<h1>Student Saxophones</h1>
<p>There are a number of makes and models 
of student instruments on the market today. These instruments are created 
as an entry point into playing the saxophone, and traditionally have 
nickel-plated rods and keywork. The craftsmanship, intonation, 
tone, and evenness are not what you would find in an intermediate or 
professional level instrument, but these instruments can be adequate 
for a beginning saxophonist.</p>
<p>The equipment a beginning student starts 
with is very important, and a substandard or poorly regulated instrument 
can hinder a student&#39;s development and enthusiasm for music. For that 
reason, even when buying a first instrument, it is important to choose 
wisely, preferably with the help of a teacher or experienced saxophonist. </p>
<p>I recommend not spending a lot of money 
on a student level instrument; try to buy a good quality used instrument, 
and have it checked by a technician to ensure that it is in good condition 
and properly regulated. Another alternative is to rent until you know 
you&#39;d like to continue. When possible, try to start with an intermediate 
level instrument, which you won&#39;t outgrow as quickly. </p>
<p>Below is a listing of some student 
level saxophones for consideration. In particular, I recommend either 
the Yamaha YAS-23 or Selmer USA AS500 at the student level.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Yamaha Standard Alto Saxophone YAS/YTS-23</li>
	<li>Selmer (USA) AS500</li>
	<li>Selmer Prelude AS700</li>
	<li>Keilwerth ST90 IV</li>
</ul>
