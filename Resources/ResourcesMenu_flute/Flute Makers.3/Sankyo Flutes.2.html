<h1>Sankyo Flutes</h1>

<p>Sankyo's are known for their 
signature sound and evenness of technique. The shape of the lip plate 
allows for better air focus, and is ideal for the intermediate student 
who is developing a refined and polished sound. These handmade flutes 
are a great value and very popular. I have played Sankyo flutes and 
have very satisfied students with them.</p>
