<h1>Avanti Flutes</h1>
<p>The Avanti flute company is 
a product of a collaboration of the professional flute company Brannen 
and Conn-Selmer, and the result is a synthesis of the smooth mechanism 
and robust sound reminiscent of Brannen flutes, and the reliability 
and cost-effectiveness of the Conn-Selmer company of student instruments.</p>
<p>Avanti flutes are great for 
the intermediate flutist who is ready for an open-holed instrument and 
wants to work on developing a rich, full tone. The mechanism is very 
smooth and the instruments have the look and feel of a professional 
flute but at a reasonable price. The sound on the Avanti flute is rich 
and solid, good for the intermediate and advanced intermediate flutist 
who has good breath control and support.</p>
