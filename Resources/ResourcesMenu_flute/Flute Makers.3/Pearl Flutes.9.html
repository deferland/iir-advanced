<h1>Pearl Flutes</h1>

<p>Pearl makes solid student and 
intermediate flutes, as well a line of professional flutes. The company 
has been around for 50 years and continues to put out god quality instruments. 
One of the attractions of Pearl flutes is that every line of flutes, 
from the student models to the professional line, has the split E mechanism 
as a standard feature. The split E mechanism is not entirely necessary 
for student flutes, but is a useful feature for more intermediate students.</p>
