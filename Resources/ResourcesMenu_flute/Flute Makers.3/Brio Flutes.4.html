<h1>Brio Flutes</h1>
<p>Brio flutes come from the Gemeinherdt 
flute company and they produce a series of intermediate flutes. The 
flute has a sturdy frame and a pretty smooth action, but the highlight 
is the headjoint, which is handmade by Dana Sheridan. Dana Sheridan 
makes some the highest quality professional headjoints, and for Brio 
to have this partnership really elevates the level of this flute from 
an average, to a <i>good</i> intermediate flute. The cut of the Dana 
Sheridan headjoint produces a brilliant sound, which is more substantial 
than Azumi, but still brighter than Avanti. Another positive feature 
is the professional look of the instrument, with its French (pointed 
key) arms and gold springs.</p>

<h3>Brio B10-OSB/SB (offset/inline G)</h3>
  <p>French or open hole, sterling 
  silver handcut Dana Sheridan series headjoint, silver plated body, footjoint 
  and keys, silver plated mechanism, offset/ inline G, stainless steel 
  springs, dapped (Y-arm) keywork, B footjoint</p>

<h3>Brio B1-OSB/SB (offset/inline G)</h3>
<p>Same as B10 but with gold springs. Gold springs may marginally add to the sound.</p>

<h3>Brio B20-OSB/SB (offset/inline G)</h3>
<p>French or open hole, sterling 
  silver handcut Dana Sheridan series headjoint, silver body and footjoint, 
  silver plated keys, offset/inline G, stainless steel springs, dapped 
  (Y-arm) keywork, B footjoint.</p>

<h3>Brio B2-OSB/SB</h3>
<p>Same as B20 except with gold springs.</p>

<h3>Brio B2.4-OSB/SB</h3>
<p>Flute is 9K rose gold plated. 
  Gold plated flutes add a slight amount of the warmth of the solid gold 
  flutes, but at a much more reasonable price. Gold plated is not a substitute 
  for a gold flute!</p>

<p>French or open hole, sterling 
  silver handcut Dana Sheridan series headjoint, sterling silver body, 
  footjoint and keys, offset /inline G, gold springs, pointed key arms, 
  B footjoint</p>
