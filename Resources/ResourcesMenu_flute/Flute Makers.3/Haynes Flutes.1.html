<h1>Haynes Flutes</h1>
<p>Haynes flutes are one of the 
3 major Boston-based flute manufacturers (along with Powell and Brannen) 
that dominate the professional market. Of the 3 companies, the Haynes 
flute has a rich history of world-renowned advocates, including Jean-Pierre 
Rampal.</p>
<p>Haynes flutes are known and 
revered for their rich, colorful sound. I have assisted many students 
in the purchase of new instruments and time and time again they are 
drawn to and choose the beauty of the Haynes sound. These instruments 
have the capacity to draw out the very best of the musicians and many 
of my students have made immediate and significant improvements in their 
playing after the purchase of a Haynes flute.</p>
<p>Haynes flutes are my personal 
favorite flutes as a professional, and they have recently come out with 
a line of intermediate flutes, called Haynes Classic. These flutes are 
great for the aspiring professional high school student who wants to 
transform their playing and take it to the next level.</p>
