<h1>Azumi Flutes</h1>
<p>The Azumi flute is made by 
Altus, a Japanese flute company which produces professional flutes. 
Among the Japanese flutes for intermediate flutists of middle and high 
school age, the Azumi company produces the highest quality. The headjoint 
is based on the Altus "Z" cut which focuses the sound beautifully, 
and a great component to the intermediate level flute. The flute is 
very easy to play and best for the advanced beginner and intermediate 
student who is still learning and developing breath support and control. 
It is difficult to produce a big complex sound, so it may not be the 
best for more developed players.</p>
