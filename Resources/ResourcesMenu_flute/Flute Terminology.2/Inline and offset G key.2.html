<h1>Inline/offset G key</h1> 
 
<p>This refers to the key that is used by the left hand ring finger. 
All student flutes have an offset G key to compensate for the smaller 
hands of young flutists. Traditionally, as the students grow, the need 
for an offset G key has diminishes and the more advanced flutes are 
made with an inline G key. However, the offset G key is now requested 
more often in professional flutes because it adds a bit of relief to 
the hand. I would recommend looking for a flute with an offset G key 
unless the student has rather large hands.</p>
