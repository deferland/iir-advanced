<h1>Open hole/closed hole (plateau/French)  </h1>
<p>All students who start out should start on 
a closed holed instrument. If the student is young and has very small 
fingers, it might be difficult to cover the holes on the keys. As the 
student progresses and is ready for the next step up in the level of 
flutes, I would highly recommend an open holed flute. For students who 
start out on closed hole flutes, I would not recommend getting one that 
was sterling silver. The money would be more efficiently spent on an 
open holed flute with sterling silver headjoint or body.</p>
