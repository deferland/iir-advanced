<h1>Split E mechanism </h1>
<p> This refers to the mechanism that helps the intonation and the production 
of the high notes. This is a very useful tool for advanced flutists 
who are careful about their intonation while playing in ensembles or 
bands. I wouldn't recommend them to student flutes because the cost 
to have it as an option is rather high and students at this stage wouldn't 
need the split E as much until they become more advanced. </p>
