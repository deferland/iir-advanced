<h1>Gold lip plate/riser/gold plated  </h1>

<p>Generally speaking, the gold material produces a warmer 
tone, and some flute makers use gold to enhance the instrument's sonority. 
A gold lip plate will not do as much to the sound as a gold riser. The 
gold riser is the small tube on which the lip plate sits. The air goes 
directly through the riser, and that will affect the sound more than 
the lip plate itself, which is essentially a platform for the lips to 
make the embouchure. I would only recommend a gold riser to someone 
if they are getting an advanced flute that is already all sterling silver. 
Gold plated will enhance the sound a bit, but not nearly as much as 
a gold alloy or a 5K or 10K flute would. The cost of the gold plating 
is not offset by the amount of improvement to the sound.</p>
