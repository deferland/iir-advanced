<h1>Soldered/drawn tone holes</h1>

<p> Refers to the method of creating the tone holes. Tone holes that 
are soldered are made from either the same or different material as 
the tube and are placed on the tube. With drawn tone holes, the tone 
holes are actually "drawn" or taken from the tube itself. This option 
is primarily for more advanced flutes. Generally soldered tone holes 
can improve the sound of the flute.</p>
