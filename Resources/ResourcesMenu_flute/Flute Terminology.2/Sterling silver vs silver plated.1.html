<h1>Sterling silver vs silver plated</h1>
  
<p>Generally, the more silver the flute has, the better 
the sound quality and value of the flute. Usually when a flute is silver 
plated, the main material is nickel with a silver coating on it. Beginner 
flutes and those just starting out do not need to worry as much about 
the amount of silver in their flutes, but as the student progresses 
beyond the first flute, you will want to consider buying a silver flute. 
If you can, try for at least a sterling silver headjoint and lip plate 
and silver plated body and keys.</p>
