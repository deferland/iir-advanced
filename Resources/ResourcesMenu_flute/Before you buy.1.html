<h1>Before buying your new flute</h1>
<p>There are some things to keep 
in mind while shopping for a new instrument. Please try different models 
and types. A flute that might work for your friend may not be the best 
for you. Depending on the shape and size of your lips, you may find 
that some work better than others. Certain flute makers cut their lip 
plates differently and there may be some types that produce more focused 
sounds for you than others. Some lip plates are cut small and round, 
and some others are larger and more square shaped, providing more resonance. 
It is impossible to know which one will work for you unless you try 
them out.</p>
