-------------------------------------
Version 1.1 Changes - July 29, 2008
-------------------------------------

Added a new version of the FormBuilder Manager (thanks to Todd Crowe) 
that uses an improved form/field hierarchy.

Added a new version of the manager.class.php super class 
to support the new FormBuilder.

Fixed a WYMeditor bug related to the root path of WYMeditor. 
The bug prevented SkyBlueCanvas from running properly in a 
sub-directory of the web root.

Fixed a bug in the PHP file that builds the Internal Pages selector 
for the Link button overlay in WYMeditor. The script now properly 
uses SEF or non-SEF URLs depending on whether or not the .htaccess 
file is present.

Added a new RSS Feed to the Main Dashboard showing the latest 
SkyBlueCanvas News and Blog Entries.

Updated the Page Manager to add the Meta Description.

Updated the SkinBuilder to support the Meta Description object on pages.


-------------------------------------
Version 1.1 Changes - Aug 03, 2008
-------------------------------------

Added The ability to publish/unpublish ads, gadgets and plugins

Added The ability to publish/unpublish pages from the List View

Added The ability to add collections to a page and page-region from 
within the Page Manager (huge improvement)

Added The ability to re-order items in the List View of several 
Managers (Thanks, Todd)

Added New Task icons* in the List View

Added More flexible Banner Ad naming (zones are automagically 
generated based on the ad file name)

Added Several WYMeditor bug fixes

Added New Resources panel on the Main Dashboard

Added Meta Description now in the Page Manager

Added Tabbed form on the Page Manager (we need to test this on all browsers)

Added 2 new templates from StyleShout.com (TechJunkie and VectorLover)

Added page-specific JavaScript files to your skins. For instance, if you 
have a layout skin named skin.alternate.html, you can add a JavaScript 
file that only loads on this page by creating a file named 
skin.alternate.js in /skyblue_root/data/skins/your_skin/js/.

Improvements to the plugin code for class-based plugins. The code previously 
would create a new instance of the class for each invocation of the plugin 
within a page.  We changed the code to keep track of the plugin classes on a 
page and only instantiates them once. This saves overhead and allows the 
constructor to be used to initialize (or load from files/DB) data that is 
used in subsequent invocations. This may break existing class based plugins 
but this memory-management was a necessary change.

New Banner Ads Manager so you can place banner ads through the Admin Console. 
Previously banner ads were required to be added via FTP only.

Added 3 new classes to the OOP hierarchy: SkyBlueObject, Observer and SkyBlueError

Implemented the Observer Pattern to support custom event registering and firing

Moved BBCode, TidyImageTags, Preloader and NoEmpytAttrs to external plugins

Deleted a lot of deprecated and un-used code from the Core class (removed about 1,000 lines of code)

Moved the page skeleton to ui/front/ directory

Deleted the rsrc directory and all references to it

Deleted the docstruct class

Deleted legacy libraries in /skyblue_root/libs/

Fixed a bug in the Sitemapper class where the sitemap was being saved to the 
wrong location (now saved in site root)
